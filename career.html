                            <p>One company I would love to work for in the future is Target Corporation. Since Target is headquartered in Minnesota, it feels like a natural fit for my long-term goals. I'm especially interested in Target because they offer great opportunities in business analytics, guest experience, communications, and leadership development—all areas that match my major and the type of work I want to do.</p>
                            <p>I like how Target focuses on teamwork, customer service, and creating a positive experience for guests. Their company culture seems like a place where I could grow, learn, and eventually take on more responsibility.</p>

                            <p>I feel qualified for Target because of my background in Communication and Business Analytics, combined with years of experience working directly with customers. Working as a bartender, server, and landscaping crew member has taught me professionalism, multitasking, problem-solving, and how to stay calm in fast-paced environments.</p>
                            <p>Target looks for people who can communicate clearly, build relationships, and take initiative—skills I've developed in every job I've had so far.</p>

                            <p>Another company I'm interested in working for is Essentia Health, especially because it's based in Duluth.

                            <p>In addition, my Business Analytics skills give me experience with data, problem-solving, and understanding how systems work. These are valuable in healthcare operations and patient experience roles.</p>
