                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p>I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth because it struck the perfect balance between academic opportunity and a welcoming, down-to-earth community. UMD offered strong programs in both Communication and Business Analytics, giving me the chance to study two fields that genuinely interest me.</p>
                        <p>The campus environment felt friendly and supportive from the moment I visited, and I could see myself thriving both academically and socially. The smaller class sizes, hands-on learning, and approachable faculty made UMD feel like the right place to build my future.</p>

                    <div class="content-box">
                        <p>Duluth is one of the most unique and beautiful cities in Minnesota, and that's a big part of what drew me here. With Lake Superior right next to campus, the outdoor scenery is always incredible—whether it's hiking at Enger Tower, walking the Lakewalk, or exploring the North Shore.</p>
                        <p>The city has a relaxed vibe, but there's always something going on, from local restaurants and festivals to concerts and hockey games. I love that Duluth gives you access to nature while still offering a strong sense of community and a fun, lively college-town atmosphere.</p>

                        <p>One of my favorite things about UMD has been getting involved in campus life. Whether it's spending time in the Kirby Student Center, studying in the library, or going to events and games, the campus always feels alive. I've built meaningful friendships and had great experiences through classes, group projects, and student activities.</p>
                        <p>Living in Duluth has also given me experiences I wouldn't have had anywhere else—like watching the ships come in at Canal Park, exploring trails with friends, and enjoying sunsets over Lake Superior. These moments have made my time at UMD special and have helped me feel connected to both the campus and the community.</p>
